// CHAPTER 2 : VARIABLES AND ASSIGNMENTS
// 
// What is a variable? In programming it is  a container for a value. 
// It is stored at a location in a computer's memory or one of it's registers.
// Variables had defined names (AKA an identifier)
// 
// Variable names start with a LETTER either a-z or A-Z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters or numbers
// (HINT don't start with an underscore because some compilers use things starting with underscores)
//
// C++ compilers are case sensitive.
// Can't use keywords that are already reserved by the compiler (if, else, while and so on). Called reserved words.
// 
// DECLERATION
// Before you use a word as a variable you must declare it as a an appropriate data type (int, const, char etc)
// Multiple declerations can be done by seperating variable names with comas: int a, b, ... c;
// 
// HINT Use descriptive names for variable names, don't use just single letter names like x & y.
