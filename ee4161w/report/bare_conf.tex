% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan

\begin{abstract}
Wireless power transfer (WPT) has the potential to revolutionize how electronics are powered by removing the need for cable-based power solutions. This will be made possible by the availability of long range WPT technology that will allow for power transmitters to be built into spaces (houses, buildings, cars) to power electronics with receiving coils. There is great challenge in the design of long range WPT systems, however, due to issues arising mostly from insufficient coil coupling and efficiency. A solution to this problem is resonant WPT, where transmit and receive coils are designed to resonate with high Q at one frequency, which means high efficiency (low loss) and enhanced coupling. This technology has promise in allowing for power transfer in the range of meters, which is ideal for powering portable electronics in a building and similar environments.  The availability of low frequency (1-100 MHz) ISM bands that allow for unrestricted radiation of RF energy are a key factor that suggests the development of this technology is wholly feasible from a regulatory stance. The usage of these RF bands also allows for miniaturization of receiving coils, making it feasible to place receiving coils in portable electronics. All together the future of wireless power transfer featuring resonant technology looks promising in simplifying access to energy demanded by modern societies.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The explosive rise of mobile electronics in the recent history has introduced many new technological issues yet to be resolved. One stalled issue is how to power these devices. Traditionally, portable devices have been powered with secondary battery cells that are recharged via cable based methodologies. Consumer demand for increased battery life as well as greater device mobility however has been at odds with these traditional methods have done little to improve battery life since the advent of lithium battery technology. These issues have spurred interest in alternative technologies such as wireless power transfer (WPT). Generally wireless power transfer refers to cableless and contactless methods for power transfer. Some common approaches involve acoustic waves, light and RF and electromagnetic induction. Practically WPT is limited to RF and low frequency electromagnetic methods due to their high achievable efficiencies (90\% +) compared to essentially all other methods. Currently most deployed WPT technologies are what is referred to as \textit{inductive}, meaning they rely on the coupling of magnetic field between inductors (coils). Current standards such as QI, unfortunately, are designed to be near field only and limit power transfer to within a few centimeters of tethered transmitters, providing no resolution to the battery life issue. This limitation is because of a fundamental physical limitations for how well two coils can couple at a distance, which correlates to effectively power can be transfered. Coupling can be thought as closely related to the amount of flux leaving a transmitting coil compared to a receiving coil. Given EM field typically follow inverse distance laws for field strength, it is easy to understand how coupling greatly drops with distance.  A newer technology called \textit{resonant inductive coupling} \cite{massa} however has promise for long range wireless transfer and the coupling issue. While still relying on magnetically coupled coils, this solution differs in that it uses resonant high Q (low loss) coils that are all tuned to the same frequency for both the transmitter and receiver. In effect, the method works by storing energy not transmitted in a given cycle in the resonant transmitter coil. This results in a stronger field emitted by the transmitting coil and thus more flux coupling with the receiving coil, therefore greater power transfered than regular inductive methods. This is important as it can allow for devices at a distance, such as the height of a phone in hand or a computer on a table to be powered wirelessly by a remote transmitter. This transmitter could be built into the floor, wall or ceiling of a room, the interior of a car, or perhaps the floor of a garage to power electric cars. The effective integration of these transmitters into commonly inhabited environments stands as the solution to the mobile device power problem, as it would allow for the devices to be constantly powered and charged without the need for cables. Many issues stand with the realization of this technology, such as system cost, coupling and load matching to a spatially mobile device, efficacy of coupling to small receivers such as cell phones and efficiency issues due to coupling to unintended metallic objects. There are also many enabling factors as of recent, such as the availability of cost effective, high speed GaN power transistors that allow for this technology to be implemented in previously difficult to utilize but open for use ISM bands. To be a viable solution to the powering of mobile devices, resonant inductive coupling based WPT must address all of these issues and show viability to power consumer devices at full load at commonly used distances. Therefore, this paper seeks to explore the vulnerabilities and feasibility of this technology to power electronic devices as a future option to power the needs of modern electronics.

\caption{Visualization of a hypothetical resonant inductively coupled WPT system. The picture shows a large transmitter coil built into the floor of a room that would emit power via a oscillating magnetic field. A computer, shown hovering above the transmitter would also contain a coil as shown that would couple to the transmitted magnetic flux and absorb transmitted power. Note the receiving coil is much smaller than the transmitter. A large transmitter coil is needed in order to allow for reasonable coupling to the receiving device over a large number of positions. A challenge associated with this is a small portion of the transmitters flux passes through a given receiver. Therefore the transmitter requires a very high Q to ensure energy of the flux not coupled to the receiver is not lost, but stored to be later absorbed by the receiver.}
