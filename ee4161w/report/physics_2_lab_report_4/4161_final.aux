The picture shows a large transmitter coil built into the floor of a room that would emit power via a oscillating magnetic field. A computer, shown hovering above the transmitter would also contain a coil as shown that would couple to the transmitted magnetic flux and absorb transmitted power. Note the receiving coil is much smaller than the transmitter. A large transmitter coil is needed in order to allow for reasonable coupling to the receiving device over a large number of positions. A challenge associated with this is a small portion of the transmitters flux passes through a given receiver. Therefore the transmitter requires a very high Q to ensure energy of the flux not coupled to the receiver is not lost, but stored to be later absorbed by the receiver.\relax }}{2}}
