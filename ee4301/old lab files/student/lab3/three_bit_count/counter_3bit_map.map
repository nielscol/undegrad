Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=L14) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: There is more than one pad
   symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	BUF symbol "c_OBUF" (Output Signal = c)
   	PAD symbol "c" (Pad Signal = c)
   	PAD symbol "f_" (Pad Signal = f_)
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=M12) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: There is more than one pad
   symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	BUF symbol "b_OBUF" (Output Signal = b)
   	PAD symbol "b" (Pad Signal = b)
   	PAD symbol "e" (Pad Signal = e)
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=N11) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: There is more than one pad
   symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	BUF symbol "a_OBUF" (Output Signal = a)
