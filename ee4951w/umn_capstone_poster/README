A simplistic theme for beamerposter

For documentation about beamerposter see:
http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/latexbeamerposter.php

To get started you can simply compile the example poster by running 'make' on
the command line. If this does not work, you can also run
'pdflatex example.tex' instead.

For a few example posters created with (slight modificiations of) this style, see:

-> and then download the posters for the publications.
