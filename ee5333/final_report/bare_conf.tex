% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty

% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
A moving average filter design utilizing a switched capacitor circuit is described. The moving average filter was implemented with a high gain and high-speed telescopic op amp with minimum channel lengths in the FreePDK45 process. The final design is able to drive up to 1pF of load to a gain bandwidth of 731 MHz with a phase margin of 89 degrees, making it very stable. The switched capacitor circuit failed to work as designed due to deficiencies with the common mode feedback of the OP amp design decgrading performance.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Recent industrial trends push for the continual reduction in size as well as power consumption of consumer electronic devices, essentially all of which contain some form of a wireless radio. At the core of these radios are mixers, used to upconvert and downconvert signals between frequencies. Conventional receiver architectures rely on one heterodyne receiver per band, which consumes large amounts of area and power for multi band systems. Direct sampled mixer approaches (e.g. MTDSM) offer a huge advantage where one mixer circuit can be used across a wide band (covering many bands), reducing die area and power usage simple by decreasing the number of circuits needed \cite{IEEEhowto:new}.\par
 
In lieu of the advantages of direct sampled mixers and their future prospect, a switched capacitor moving average filter was designed in for this project for application to direct sampling mixers. More specifically, a high performance telescopic op amp was designed as well as a switched capacitor network.

\section{Design Architecture}
A prototypical direct sampled mixer utilizing a switched capacitor is shown in figure \ref{a} \cite{IEEEhowto:ninh}. This circuit is the basis of this design project. This circuit features a LNTA, a mixer, and a SC moving average filter. As the mixer and LNTA designs are a different subject matter than that taught in 5333, only the SC part of the design was considered in this project. More specifically only the first stage of the SC cicuit was designed to avoid over complication the project.\par
A brief overview of the operation of the moving average filter is as follows: a current coming out of the RF section of the design is fed into the sampling portion of the circuit (at the caps labeled Cs). The input current contains the mixed RF signal to be filtered. The input of the MA filter then uses four switched sampling capacitors (2 per input) to convert the input current to charge (sampling in this system works on charge), with each input having two samplers that alternate sampling twice a period to yield a continuous output signal (no gaps in the sampling). The charge of Cs is then shared with a history capacitor (Ch), larger then CS, on the time Cs is not being used to sample. This sharing of charge acts as a means of implementing a IIR filter, in this case a moving average filter. The output of the circuit is then shared onto an output cap Co for measing by an ADC. The output of the circuit ideally should smooth out an input signal, isolating a downconverted signal from higher harmonics if a mixed signal is fed into the circuit.\par
The architecture of the opamp was chosen to be high bandwidth and high speed. This is to ensure high speed filtering of input signals, as well as ensuring fast settling times. To meet these needs, a telescopic op amp design with gain boosting and common mode feedback was selected.Initially a folded cascode was selected for this project, however this was changed as the benefits in terms of gain, bandwidth, and power consumption of a telescopic topology was realized (specifically the 2x lower current consumption).

\end{figure}
Some of the design specs were low, due to initially too aggressive targets.\par

The full design implemented is shown in the following figure. The circuit is a telescopic cascode with gain boosting and input common mode feedback. The starting point for this design was the gain bandwidth, load capacitance. From these numbers and the FOM for the project, 1mA bias current for the cascode was decided upon. From there, 0.1V Vds was chosen to allow for large output swing. Running several simulations sweeping the size of the cascode transistors showed 10u to be the optimal size for having the input common level be half Vdd. From there I sized the tail mosfet to twice the cascode ones, and the PFETS to also be 2x to lower the VGS. This design also has gain boosing, shown as the triangles, implemented as two stage op amps that take in a reference which sets the quiescent point to the node between the cascode transistors. There is also a CM input FB circuit. These will be discussed next.

The following is the gain boosting amplifier used on the lower half of the cascode. The design is a two stage op amp with p inputs in order to sense the low 0.1 V signal at the feedback node. This signal is compared to a 0.1V reference in the 5T pair and the output is then buffered through an inverting amplifier. The inv. amplifier output connects to the transistor being controlled by the gain boosting circuit. The sizes for this circuit were selected for 20uA bias and minimal size.

The next circuit is the gain boosting amp for the P channel device half of the cascode. The operation is the same (complementary) to the previous one so I will not discuss it further. Design considerations were made for 10uA bias currents, minimal channel size, and channel length were found via simulation and selecting the optimal size.

The voltage reference for the opamp is shown below. It is implemented using a self-biasing threshold-referenced current referent, which has good supply rejection. This circuit works as the upper half is a current mirror, and the lower is a resistor with a different current transfer reletionship. The circuit operates stably at the intersection of the current transfer curves, with small deviations due to power supply variations. The voltage for the circuit is refered across the resistor as it has the best PSRR. All other bias voltages are generated from this reference voltage using complementry chains of P and NMOS tranistors sized to output the correct voltages when the NMOS is connected to the reference.

\FloatBarrier
The following graphic is a simulation of the voltage out of the reference vs a sweep on supply voltage. We see very little change in the output voltage, approximately a sensitivity of 0.1. This is far lower than what you would see with only using a resistor and a current mirror (0.1) for a reference.

This last circuit is the commom mode feedback circuit for the input. This works by sensing the common mode level with a differential pair connected at both the drain and source, using transistors 1/40 the size of the op amp input transistors, and biased at the same level. THe current from the diff pair is forced through a NMOS 1/40 of the size of the op amp tail transistor, which generates a reference level for the tail transistor that takes in common mode level. An opamp in used to try to force the VDS across the tail transistor to be 0.1 volts at all times to ensure high cascode impedance.

The following plot is a VTC for the designed op amp, swept from rail to rail to the input. The outputs cross as intended at half VDD for both output and input. The gain was also extracted by differentiating the curve. The observed gain is 681, or about 56dB, which is quite good. This is nearly 20db better than the design without the gain boosting (gain of 74). Therefore the gain boosting is deemed helpful. Also, the high gain value will help to give a fast rise time, as rise time is at a minimimum 1/GBWP, or 1.37ns.

The following is the bode plots for open loop performance of the opamp with 0.5pF of load on each output (1pF total). We see that the unity gain frequency is 731 MHz, with a phase margin of 89 degrees, meaning stablility is given, as well as no ringing.

These last two plots show the deficiencies of the opamp in simulation. With a 10MHz signal fed into the amplifier, the output common mode level of the opamp hit the top rail. This was not seen in the OP amp only simulation, so was hard to correct for after designing the op amp. The railing of the output causes the circuit to fail to output any signal (last plot). This would be fixed by implementing better common mode feedback, particularly on the output, however I didn't have time for this.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,

% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
