\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s28\sl480\slmult1\itap0{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab Last year I went up north with my dad to visit the Soudan Mine Underground Laboratory. We drove along 35W most of the way until we reached Duluth. 35W wasn\uc1\u8217\'92t particularly interesting, as it was predominantly surrounded by commercial and city type landscapes as well as billboards. However, the further north we went, things changed to be more scenic. The familiar landscapes of the city were starting to be replaced by coniferous forests lining the roads, and as we finally approached Duluth we were treated to the scenic view of Lake Superior and the canal area. From Duluth, we made our way north along the quaint north shore on highway 61, seeing few people along the way. Then, we took highway 1, deep through the north woods straight to Ely. Highway 1 became immensely beautiful as we neared Ely we went through the lush woods on curvy roads. Finally, we arrived in Ely. As we dropped our stuff in our hotel room, we began to walk down the main road in Ely, greeted by dozens of businesses along the road. One restaurant we walked by gave off a warm, welcoming vibe as a live band was playing at it. We decided to eat there. We got savory fried walleye and chicken, and it was delicious. Finally, after walking about some more, we returned to our hotel. The next day we woke up bright and early, and departed Ely to the Soudan Mine. It was extremely quiet that morning, as we only saw maybe a couple other cars along out way to Soudan. As we finally arrived to the mine, we saw a couple small buildings. We walked into the main one, and found a reception desk were we checked in  and waited like the other people who were already there. We then proceeded to the helmet room, where the tour guides handed out construction helmets, and from there we went to the elevator. The elevator was a small, maybe 4 foot square by 7 foot tall rustic cage. All 18 of us in our group then begrudgingly  crammed into the small cage, and then the half mile descent into the mine begin. The ride way several minutes of darkness, violent rattling and loud noises as the the cage grinded along and banged its way along the elevator shaft. Finaly, we reached the bottom of the mine, level 17. It was cool, and we began our tour. They took us over to a from the elevator to a nearby cavern with a massive particle detector that is meant to detect neutrinos. It was rather impressive. In the cave there was a large, colorful mural spanning the way. Our tour was short, and we were then sent back up in the dark, disconcerting elevator to the surface. From there, me and my dad drove back to Duluth, were we met up with my mom and sister. }{\s28\f0\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}}
